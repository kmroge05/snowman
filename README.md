# Welcome to Snowman!

Snowman is a variant of the game Hangman. Like Hangman, the player will be given a word to guess. The player can guess 1 letter at a time until he or she either guess the word correctly, or has guessed incorrectly 10 times. As you guess incorrectly, a snowman will be built. Once you get 10 inocrrect guesses, the full snowman will be displayed. Whether the player wins or loses, he or she can decide if they want to view the definition of the word at the end.

2. Words used in the game are stored in a List, and retireieved at random to use for the game.
3. Connects to a Dictionary API that will provide you with the definition of the word at the end of a game.
